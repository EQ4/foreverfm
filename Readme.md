Forever.fm is a web app that provides and endless, beatmatched radio stream of the hottest tracks on SoundCloud. Check out the [absurdly long blog post on its creation](http://petersobot.com/blog/introducing-forever-fm) or the [site itself](http://forever.fm). Check out the code above if you're interested in some learnin'.



##Installation

Hehe. Good luck. The code has too many dependencies to countâ€¦ but I might be able to go back and add a `requirements.txt` eventually. It also depends on custom forks of the Echo Nest's client-side Python libraries and SoundCloud's Python library.
