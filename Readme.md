Forever.fm is a web app that provides an endless beatmatched radio stream of the hottest tracks on SoundCloud. Check out the [absurdly long blog post on its creation](http://petersobot.com/blog/introducing-forever-fm) or the [site itself](http://forever.fm). Check out the code above if you're interested in some learnin'.



##Installation

Hehe. Good luck. The code has too many dependencies to countâ€¦ but I might be able to go back and add a `requirements.txt` eventually. It also depends on custom forks of the Echo Nest's client-side Python libraries and SoundCloud's Python library.

***Update***: I've added a requirements.txt, but you'll also need to use my custom forks of [remix](https://github.com/psobot/remix) and [pyechonest](https://github.com/psobot/pyechonest), and for now, my fork (and patch) of [soundcloud-python](https://github.com/psobot/soundcloud-python/tree/patch-1).
